## New page or old page?
**The goal of this project** is to help the company understand **if they should implement the new page**, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision for _an e-commerce website_ according to **the converted rate**.  
**A/B test** and **regression** are performed in this project.

## Practical Statistics

#### 1 The limitation of Probability  
The data we‘ve got is just **a sample from the population**, which **cannot includes all the conditions** To make an inference for the whole population, we need to conduct **hypothesis testing**.

#### 2 A/B Test
* Null and alternative hypotheses
* P-value
* z-score
* Sampling distribution
* [z-score and P-vaule table](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/tool-reference/spatial-statistics/what-is-a-z-score-what-is-a-p-value.htm)

#### 3 Regression
* Multiple Linear Regression
* Logistic Regression


## Results & Conclusions
Based on all the tests we’ve performed, it clearly showed that **country and page don't have an impact on conversion**.  
The company may better find other influencing factors that can actually have an impact on conversion.
